# Eclipse19-20


Code for autonomous and teleop phases of FTC Skystone 2019 for Alpharetta Robotics Eclipse. 

10.22.19

For testing the code:
test AutonBlueRight, AutonBlueLeft, AutonRedRight, and AutonRedLeft.
Please test the timing of the commands (those can be edited through the last parameter of each command)
and the timing of the turn left and right (those can be edited through changing the last parameter of the driveMethod 
under the turnRight and turnLeft methods).

DoNothing method:
after the driver presses play, the robot does nothing for two seconds. This can be changed if the robot goes over 30 seconds, but keep it at least one second.
